# Welcome to DomainLang

The DomainLang language enables you to describe a domain-driven design architecture through a simple notation.

## Get started

Currently, [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is supported.

 * From VS Code, run `npm run gen:build` to generate the grammer tree and compile the project
 * Press `F5` to open a new window with your extension loaded
 * Open one of the samples or create a new file with the `.dlang` extension to start playing around

## Usage

The language is centered around a few central concepts:

- Domains are defined by the `Domain` keyword
- Bounded contexts are defined by the `BoundedContext` keyword
