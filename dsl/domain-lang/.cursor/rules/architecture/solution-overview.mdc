# Project goals

Inspired by the [ContextMapper DSL](https://github.com/ContextMapper/context-mapper-dsl), I wanted to try crafting a more complete DDD specification language, one that can be used for diagrams-as-code for DDD and at the same time serve as a semantic and *compilable*, model of a domain-driven architecture.

## Goals

I want to provide a great IDE experience with code-completion and everything else you might be used to from coding. Preferably, this is going to work quite easy with VSCode.

On top of this, I plan to provide diagramming-support through GraphViz or similar, and an exploration UI to inspect your model, probably through a browser.
