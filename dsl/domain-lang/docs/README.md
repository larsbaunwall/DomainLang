# DomainLang documentation

This folder contains the end-user documentation for writing `.dlang` models.

> [!TIP]
> Start with Getting started, keep Quick reference open while you model, and use Language reference when you need exact semantics.

## Read this in order

1. [Getting started](getting-started.md): build a small model end-to-end
2. [Quick reference](quick-reference.md): syntax cheat sheet while you model
3. [Language reference](language.md): authoritative semantics and full syntax
4. [Import system](imports.md): multi-file models, dependencies, and manifest

## Examples

Browse ready-to-run models in [../examples/](../examples/):

> [!NOTE]
> The examples are the fastest way to learn idiomatic structure and naming.

- [Customer-facing](../examples/customer-facing.dlang)
- [Banking system](../examples/banking-system.dlang)
- [Healthcare system](../examples/healthcare-system.dlang)
- [Multi-file project](../examples/multi-file-project/) - demonstrates imports and manifest
