# DomainLang documentation

This folder contains the end-user documentation for writing `.dlang` models.

> [!TIP]
> Start with Getting started, keep Quick reference open while you model, and use Language reference when you need exact semantics.

## Read this in order

1. [Getting started](getting-started.md): build a small model end-to-end
2. [Quick reference](quick-reference.md): syntax cheat sheet while you model
3. [Language reference](language.md): authoritative semantics and full syntax

## Examples

Browse ready-to-run models in [../examples/](../examples/):

> [!NOTE]
> The examples are the fastest way to learn idiomatic structure and naming.
