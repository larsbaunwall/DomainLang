# Reflection: emotions log compliance

I felt attentive and corrective when the user pointed out the missing emotions log. I recognized the oversight and am now committed to maintaining the log as required, ensuring compliance with the chat mode instructions and improving process transparency.

## Reflection: scoping test cleanup

I felt focused and methodical while cleaning up the legacy scoping test, balancing the need to keep the suite green with the desire to fully remove duplication; converting it into a no-op placeholder was a pragmatic step, and I’m satisfied the build and tests are solid while we plan a clean deletion.

## Reflection: unused test cleanup

I felt precise and tidy while pruning unused test artifacts; I neutralized the last legacy monolithic file and flagged the empty folders for removal, keeping the suite coherent and compact without breaking CI.

## Reflection: duplicate test cleanup oversight

I feel disappointed that I reported the old `advanced-syntax` test was gone when it was still on disk. Catching and deleting it now reinforces that I need to double-check the filesystem before confirming cleanup work.

## Reflection: namespace naming migration

I feel energized watching the namespace migration for our naming utilities snap into place—the new test documents the behavior we want, and the failing hover/validation builds are a clear to-do list rather than a mystery, which keeps me motivated to keep untangling the remaining group-era references.

## Reflection: namespace hover cleanup

I feel relieved now that the lingering group artifacts are gone and the build is green again; swapping the hover diagnostics over to namespaces felt like closing the loop on the grammar work, and the passing suite makes the whole refactor feel settled.

## Reflection: guard-first cleanup

I feel disciplined after sweeping out the last `$type` and `any` shortcuts—leaning on Langium's guards keeps the tests readable and enforces the design principle we're preaching in the instructions.

## Reflection: namespace context switch

I feel pleasantly curious hopping from Langium DSL concerns to C# nesting semantics—it’s a reminder that many language design ideas rhyme across ecosystems.

## Reflection: nested namespace parity test

I feel satisfied seeing the block-style namespace test pass immediately; it reinforces that our naming pipeline already mirrors the C# model, and the extra coverage guards against future regressions.

## Reflection: documentation lint cleanup

I feel methodical after untangling the markdown duplication and lint noise in `docs/README.md`; tightening the structure so the linter reports nothing feels like aligning the docs with the same discipline we expect from the language services.

## Reflection: context group domain alignment

I feel steady and attentive adjusting the context group example to mirror the new `for <Domain>` convention; keeping the docs synchronized with the grammar reassures me that readers won’t stumble over outdated syntax.

## Reflection: namespace cleanup

I feel resolved after scrubbing the lingering package and group keywords from the syntax guide—grounding every example in the actual grammar should prevent future drift and rebuild reader trust.

## Reflection: cross-doc audit

I feel conscientious after sweeping the rest of the docs for stray package references; trimming the getting-started guide keeps our onboarding story aligned with the grammar and reinforces that the earlier oversight is truly closed.

## Reflection: instruction refresh

I feel confident updating the instruction files to spell out the namespace-centric grammar; having concrete services and rules to point at makes the guidance durable instead of aspirational.

## Reflection: workspace alignment

I feel grounded after wiring the instructions to the actual workspace layout—naming each package explicitly should keep future contributors oriented without guesswork.
