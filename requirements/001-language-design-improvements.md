# PRS-001: Language Design Improvements (2025 Review)

Status: Draft
Priority: High
Target Version: 2.0.0
Review Date: October 8, 2025
Reviewers: Language Designer Agent, Software Architect Agent

## Overview

Based on comprehensive language design and architectural reviews conducted in October 2025, this PRS captures critical improvements needed to enhance DomainLang's ease of use, consistency, completeness, and developer experience. The reviews identified DomainLang as having excellent foundational design (4/5 rating for language, 7.5/10 for architecture) with specific gaps that prevent it from achieving best-in-class status.

The primary gaps are: (1) missing tactical DDD patterns, (2) excessive synonym overload causing confusion, (3) inconsistent operator semantics, and (4) insufficient test coverage and operational excellence.

## User Stories

### US-1: Strategic DDD Practitioner
As a domain architect,
I want clear, canonical keyword syntax with minimal ambiguity,
So that I can model domains quickly without decision fatigue.

### US-2: Tactical DDD Practitioner
As a software architect implementing DDD,
I want to model Aggregates, Entities, and DomainEvents in DomainLang,
So that I can bridge strategic models to code implementation.

### US-3: New DomainLang User
As a developer learning DomainLang,
I want progressive learning materials and consistent patterns,
So that I can become productive within 1 hour instead of 4+ hours.

### US-4: Domain Expert (Non-Technical)
As a domain expert reviewing models,
I want natural language relationship syntax,
So that I can understand integration patterns without cryptic abbreviations.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] New user time-to-first-model reduced from ~4 hours to <1 hour
- [ ] Test coverage increased from current state to 80%+ across all modules
- [ ] Tactical DDD patterns (Aggregate, Entity, ValueObject, DomainEvent) fully supported
- [ ] Canonical keyword forms documented and enforced via linting
- [ ] Assignment operator semantics clearly defined with validation warnings
- [ ] Progressive learning materials created (3 levels: Essentials, Strategic, Advanced)
- [ ] User satisfaction rating >8/10 in post-implementation survey
- [ ] Feature parity with ContextMapper DSL for tactical patterns

## Functional Requirements

### Must Have (Phase 1: Foundation - 2-3 weeks)

#### FR-1.1: Reduce Keyword Synonym Overload
**Current Issue:** 4 keywords for BoundedContext (`BoundedContext`, `boundedcontext`, `BC`, `Context`)

**Requirement:**
- Establish canonical forms: `BoundedContext` (primary), `BC` (shorthand)
- Deprecate `Context` keyword (too ambiguous)
- Document canonical vs secondary forms in language guide
- Add deprecation warnings for discouraged forms

**Rationale:** Reduces cognitive load and decision fatigue. Matches modern DSL conventions (1 primary + 1 shorthand maximum).

#### FR-1.2: Document Assignment Operator Semantics
**Current Issue:** 3 operators (`:`, `=`, `is`) with no semantic distinction

**Requirement:**
- Define semantic conventions:
  - `:` for property-value pairs (JSON/YAML style) - `description: "Sales"`
  - `is` for classifications/states (natural language) - `classifier is CoreDomain`
  - `=` for configuration/implementation - `language = "TypeScript"`
- Create style guide with examples
- Add validation info hints for unconventional usage
- Update all examples to follow conventions

**Rationale:** Eliminates confusion about which operator to use. Provides semantic guidance for better model readability.

#### FR-1.3: Inline/Block Conflict Validation
**Current Issue:** Can specify same property inline AND in block with no warning

```dlang
BC Sales for Domain1 as CoreRole by Team1 {
    role: SupportingRole   // Conflicts with inline 'as CoreRole'
    team: Team2            // Conflicts with inline 'by Team1'
}
```

**Requirement:**
- Add validation warnings when property appears in both inline and block forms
- Document precedence rules (inline takes precedence)
- Suggest consistent style in warning messages
- Update language guide with best practices

**Rationale:** Prevents confusing models that specify conflicting values.

#### FR-1.4: ESLint Strict Rules Configuration
**Current Issue:** Empty ESLint configuration leaves code quality to developer discretion

**Requirement:**
- Configure strict ESLint rules for TypeScript
- Enable recommended rules from `@typescript-eslint`
- Add custom rules for Langium patterns
- Integrate linting into CI/CD pipeline
- Fix all existing linting violations

**Rationale:** Ensures consistent code quality and catches common errors early.

#### FR-1.5: Test Coverage Measurement and Enforcement
**Current Issue:** Only 118 test cases across 16 files, no coverage metrics

**Requirement:**
- Add Vitest coverage reporting (c8/istanbul)
- Set minimum coverage threshold: 80% across all modules
- Display coverage in CI/CD
- Block PRs that reduce coverage below threshold
- Create coverage badge for README

**Rationale:** Ensures reliability and catches regressions. Industry standard for production-grade software.

### Should Have (Phase 2: Tactical DDD - 6-8 weeks)

#### FR-2.1: Aggregate Support ⭐ **Highest Value**
**Current Gap:** Missing tactical DDD patterns, preventing complete DDD modeling

**Requirement:**

Add grammar support for:
- `Aggregate` - Consistency boundary with root entity
- `Entity` - Object with identity
- `ValueObject` - Immutable object without identity
- `DomainEvent` - Domain occurrence worth tracking
- `Command` - Intent to change aggregate state
- `Invariant` - Business rule that must always hold

**Example:**
```dlang
BC OrderManagement for Sales {
    Aggregate Order {
        root: Order

        Entity Order {
            orderId: OrderId
            customerId: CustomerId
            items: OrderItem[]
            status: OrderStatus
        }

        ValueObject OrderItem {
            productId: ProductId
            quantity: Quantity
            price: Money
        }

        Event OrderPlaced {
            trigger: "Customer completes checkout"
            orderId: OrderId
            timestamp: DateTime
        }

        Command PlaceOrder {
            customerId: CustomerId
            items: OrderItem[]
        }

        Invariant MinimumOrderValue {
            rule: "Total order value must exceed $10"
        }
    }
}
```

**Rationale:**
- Completes DDD coverage (strategic + tactical)
- Enables code generation for domain models
- Supports Event Storming outcomes
- Achieves feature parity with ContextMapper DSL

#### FR-2.2: Basic Type System
**Current Gap:** No type system for properties

**Requirement:**

Add type references for properties:
- Primitive types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `Date`, `DateTime`, `Money`, `UUID`, `Email`, `URL`
- Custom types: References to defined ValueObjects/Entities
- Array types: `Type[]`
- Optional types: `Type?`

**Example:**
```dlang
ValueObject OrderItem {
    productId: UUID           // Primitive
    quantity: number          // Primitive
    price: Money              // Primitive
    notes: string?            // Optional
}
```

**Rationale:** Enables type checking, code generation, and schema validation.

#### FR-2.3: Aggregate Boundary Validation
**Requirement:**
- Validate that Aggregates contain at least one Entity
- Warn when Aggregates grow too large (>7 entities - code smell)
- Validate that root Entity exists if specified
- Check for circular dependencies between Aggregates

**Rationale:** Enforces DDD best practices and catches design anti-patterns.

---

### Should Have (Phase 3: Implementation Bridge - 3-4 weeks)

#### FR-3.1: Implementation Metadata Block
**Current Gap:** No way to specify technology mapping

**Requirement:**

Add implementation metadata for code generation:
```dlang
BC OrderManagement {
    implementation {
        language: "TypeScript"
        framework: "NestJS"
        database: "PostgreSQL"
        messagebus: "RabbitMQ"
        repository: "github.com/company/order-service"
        deployment: "Kubernetes"
    }
}
```

**Rationale:** Connects models to code, supports infrastructure generation.

#### FR-3.2: API Specification Support
**Current Gap:** Relationships show connections but not interfaces

**Requirement:**

Add API contract definitions:
```dlang
BC OrderManagement {
    API OrderAPI {
        protocol: REST
        version: "v1"

        POST /orders returns OrderId
        GET /orders/:id returns Order

        publishes OrderPlaced to "orders.placed"
        publishes OrderCancelled to "orders.cancelled"
    }
}
```

**Rationale:** Documents integration contracts, enables API gateway configuration, supports contract testing.

#### FR-3.3: Service Level Objectives
**Current Gap:** No way to specify non-functional requirements

**Requirement:**

Add SLO definitions:
```dlang
BC OrderManagement {
    slo Availability {
        target: 99.9%
        measurement: "uptime per month"
    }

    slo Latency {
        p99: 200ms
        p95: 100ms
    }
}
```

**Rationale:** Documents operational requirements for DevOps integration.

#### FR-3.4: Lifecycle Markers
**Current Gap:** No way to indicate context status

**Requirement:**

Add status annotations:
```dlang
@deprecated("Use NewOrderService instead")
BC LegacyOrders { }

@experimental
BC AIRecommendations { }

@stable
BC Checkout { }
```

**Rationale:** Documents architectural evolution and migration paths.

---

### Could Have (Phase 4: Developer Experience - 2-3 weeks)

#### FR-4.1: Progressive Learning Materials
**Requirement:**

Create three-level learning path:
- **Level 1: Essentials (30 minutes)** - Domain, BC, Team, Classification, basic properties
- **Level 2: Strategic (4 hours)** - Context Maps, Relationships, Integration patterns
- **Level 3: Advanced (8+ hours)** - Package management, Git dependencies, Governance

**Deliverables:**
- Tutorial for each level
- Code examples at each level
- Interactive exercises
- VS Code snippets for common patterns

**Rationale:** Reduces time-to-productivity from 4+ hours to <1 hour for Level 1.

#### FR-4.2: Enhanced Error Messages
**Requirement:**

Replace generic parser errors with DDD-aware guidance:

**Before:**
```
Expecting 'for' after BoundedContext name
```

**After:**
```
Bounded Context 'Sales' needs a domain assignment. Use 'for <DomainName>'
to specify which domain this context belongs to.

Example: BC Sales for CustomerExperience
```

**Rationale:** Teaches DDD principles while guiding syntax correction.

#### FR-4.3: Natural Language Relationship Syntax
**Current Issue:** Symbolic notation is cryptic for domain experts

**Requirement:**

Add natural language alternative:
```dlang
// Current (keep for experts)
[OHS, PL] Catalog -> [ACL] Orders : UpstreamDownstream

// New alternative (for readability)
Catalog publishes OpenHostService with PublishedLanguage
    to Orders using AntiCorruptionLayer
    as UpstreamDownstream
```

**Rationale:** Improves accessibility for non-technical domain experts.

#### FR-4.4: VS Code Snippets
**Requirement:**

Add snippets for common patterns:
- `bc` → BoundedContext template
- `domain` → Domain template
- `cmap` → ContextMap template
- `agg` → Aggregate template (Phase 2+)
- `rel` → Relationship template

**Rationale:** Speeds up modeling with IntelliSense support.

---

### Could Have (Future)

#### FR-5.1: C4 Model Integration
Map DomainLang to C4 architecture views, generate Container and Component diagrams.

#### FR-5.2: Event Storming Support
Add Command, Event, Policy, ReadModel constructs for direct workshop-to-code flow.

#### FR-5.3: Internationalization
Support localized keywords for non-English domains with translation tables.

#### FR-5.4: Visual Diagramming Metadata
Add layout hints (position, color, grouping) for auto-generated diagrams.

---

## Out of Scope

**Explicitly NOT included:**
- Visual diagram editor (remains code-first)
- Runtime execution engine (language is specification-only)
- Database schema generation (future consideration)
- Complete code generation framework (start with domain models)
- UI/UX design system (CLI and IDE-focused)
- Business process modeling (BPMN) integration
- Graphical model editing (text-based DSL priority)

---

## Design Considerations

### Architectural Implications

**Grammar Evolution:**
- Maintain backward compatibility for Phase 1 changes
- Phase 2 (Tactical DDD) introduces new top-level constructs
- Use interface composition for shared properties (DescriptionBlock, etc.)

**Type System Design:**
- Start simple: primitive types + references
- Future: generics, constraints, computed types
- Avoid Turing-complete type system (keep DSL simple)

**Validation Strategy:**
- Separate validators by concern (syntax, linking, semantic, DDD rules)
- Progressive validation levels (error → warning → info → hint)
- Performance: cache validation results, incremental revalidation

**Testing Strategy:**
- Test pyramid: 70% unit, 20% integration, 10% E2E
- Grammar parsing tests for all new constructs
- Linking tests for cross-references
- Validation tests for DDD rules
- LSP feature tests (hover, completion)

### Backward Compatibility

**Breaking Changes (require major version bump):**
- Deprecating `Context` keyword (Phase 1)
- Assignment operator semantic enforcement (can be gradual with warnings)

**Non-Breaking Changes:**
- Adding tactical DDD patterns (Phase 2) - new grammar, no conflicts
- Implementation metadata (Phase 3) - optional blocks
- Progressive learning materials (Phase 4) - documentation only

**Migration Strategy:**
- Provide automated migration tool for deprecated keywords
- Grace period: 6 months of deprecation warnings before removal
- Document breaking changes in CHANGELOG with examples

## Acceptance Testing

### Test Scenarios

#### TS-1: Keyword Consistency (Phase 1)
**Given** a DomainLang file using deprecated `Context` keyword
**When** file is validated
**Then** warning appears suggesting `BoundedContext` or `BC`
**And** hover documentation shows deprecation notice

#### TS-2: Assignment Operator Usage (Phase 1)
**Given** a property using `=` for business descriptions
**When** file is validated
**Then** info hint suggests using `:` for property-value pairs
**And** no error prevents parsing

#### TS-3: Inline/Block Conflict (Phase 1)
**Given** a BoundedContext with inline `as CoreRole` and block `role: SupportingRole`
**When** file is validated
**Then** warning appears indicating conflict
**And** inline value takes precedence (documented)

#### TS-4: Aggregate Parsing (Phase 2)
**Given** a valid Aggregate definition with Entity and ValueObject
**When** file is parsed
**Then** AST contains correct structure
**And** types are resolved
**And** hover shows aggregate documentation

#### TS-5: Type System Validation (Phase 2)
**Given** an Entity with property `customerId: UUID`
**When** file is validated
**Then** type reference resolves to UUID primitive
**And** completion suggests valid types

#### TS-6: Implementation Metadata (Phase 3)
**Given** a BC with implementation block
**When** code generation runs
**Then** metadata is accessible to generators
**And** generates correct technology stack

#### TS-7: Progressive Learning (Phase 4)
**Given** a new user following Level 1 tutorial
**When** user completes 30-minute essentials
**Then** user can create valid Domain and BC model
**And** user understands basic DDD concepts

## Open Questions

### Q1: Breaking Changes Strategy
**Question:** Should deprecated `Context` keyword be removed in v2.0.0 or kept indefinitely with warnings?
**Options:**
- A) Remove in v2.0.0 (clean break, simpler grammar)
- B) Keep with warnings indefinitely (maximum compatibility)
- C) Remove in v3.0.0 (longer migration window)

**Recommendation:** Option A - Remove in v2.0.0 with migration tool and 6-month warning period.

### Q2: Assignment Operator Enforcement
**Question:** Should unconventional operator usage be an error, warning, or info hint?
**Options:**
- A) Error (strict enforcement, breaks existing files)
- B) Warning (strong guidance, non-breaking)
- C) Info hint (gentle suggestion, easy to ignore)

**Recommendation:** Option C initially (Phase 1), upgrade to Warning in Phase 2 after learning materials exist.

### Q3: Tactical DDD Scope
**Question:** Should Phase 2 include Repository and Service patterns or just Aggregates?
**Options:**
- A) Aggregates only (minimal tactical support)
- B) Aggregates + Events + Commands (Event Storming complete)
